title: Metadata groups

Since version 1.10.0 there is the possibility to group metadata. This makes it possible, for example, to divide titles into a nonSort and a Sort part and to maintain this coherence even across many different titles. Or you could save a link to the corresponding Wikipedia page for each person. Metadata groups can be formed from all defined metadata types. The only restriction is that each metadata type may only occur once. Groups can only be assigned to one object at a time.
