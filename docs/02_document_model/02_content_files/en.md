Each structural unit can also be assigned content files, whereby an m:n relation between structural units and content files is possible. These files contain the actual content of the document either as text, image, sound or video. The data format of the content file is not defined. The entire document can consist of a content file or a series of content files. A content file is always accessed via the respective structure element. The name of the respective content file has no meaning for the document. For example, the order in which certain content files are presented depends on the order of the linked structural units.
