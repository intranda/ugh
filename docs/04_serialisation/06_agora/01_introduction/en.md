The AGORA DMS system is based on a clearly defined database structure. This database structure is so flexible that different meta- and structure types can also be defined in it. However, the structure only represents a subset of the document model explained above. This subset is identical to the RDF/XML format. Further explanations can be found there. Currently this class can only write data to the AGORA database.
